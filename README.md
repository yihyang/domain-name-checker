# Domain Name Checker
A simple web program written in PHP that allows users to "ping" whether a domain is available, utilizes PHP built-in function: [checkdnsrr](http://php.net/manual/en/function.checkdnsrr.php)

## Plan:
- Convert the searching into MultiThreaded searching
- Think of something else to improve!

## License
